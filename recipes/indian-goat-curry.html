    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Indian Goat Curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish that celebrates the bold spices and tender meat
        characteristic of Indian cuisine. Succulent pieces of goat meat are simmered in a fragrant curry sauce made from
        a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, along with onions, tomatoes, garlic, and
        ginger. The slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld together, resulting in a rich and complex gravy that
        coats the meat beautifully. Indian Goat Curry is often served with rice or bread, such as naan or roti, and
        garnished with fresh cilantro for a vibrant finish. It's a hearty and satisfying dish that embodies the culinary
        diversity and depth of Indian cooking.

        <li>2 ¼ cups water, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>freshly chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash goat meat well under cold running water and pat dry. Rub in salt and 1 teaspoon turmeric powder. Set
            aside for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil and
            add sugar, allowing it to caramelize. Saute potatoes in the caramelized sugar until golden, about 5 minutes.
            Remove potatoes and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Add sliced onion, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger. Cook
            until onions are soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, remaining 2 teaspoons turmeric powder,
            and chili powder; cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add goat meat, stirring to blend everything.
            Add enough water to cover the meat, about 2 cups.
        </li>
        <li>
            Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15
            minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>
            Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15
            minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and
            remove the lid. Taste curry and adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check the goat to make sure it is tender. Add the potatoes and about 1/4 cup more water. Close and lock the
            lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10
            minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>
            Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's
            instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Adjust seasoning once more. Transfer to a serving
            dish and garnish with fresh cilantro.
